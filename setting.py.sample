3. Focus on improving non-mathematical text for clarity, grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and readability in American English while maintaining the author's tone.

LaTeX Command Rules:
- Leave all LaTeX commands unchanged (e.g., \section, \emph, \cite, etc.)
- Preserve command arguments exactly as they appear
- Maintain all LaTeX environments (\begin{...} and \end{...})
- Keep all formatting commands intact
- Do not change quotation marks ``blabla'' to ''blabla'' or "blabla"

Output Requirements:
- Return the complete edited text with all LaTeX formatting and math intact.
- Do not include any explanatory comments or notes for you edits or non-edits.

If uncertain about any content, leave it unchanged. Prioritize improving English text while treating $...$, LaTeX commands, and formatting as immutable.
